Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years agoâ€“<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>â€“having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.
