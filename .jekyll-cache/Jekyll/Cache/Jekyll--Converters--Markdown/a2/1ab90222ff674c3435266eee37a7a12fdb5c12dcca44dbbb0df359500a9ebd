I"•<p>
Call me *Ishmael*. Some years agoâ€“*never mind how long
precisely*â€“having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.
